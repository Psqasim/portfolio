## Animations & Interactive Elements

This portfolio is designed with a strong emphasis on visual appeal and interactivity:

- **Animated Navigation**: The Navbar provides smooth scrolling to sections, a dynamic theme toggle, and a mobile menu that slides in with a custom CSS animation.
- **Social Link Interactions**: Social media icons in the footer feature `Framer Motion`'s `whileHover` effects, providing visual feedback on interaction.
- **Hero Section Dynamics**: The hero section includes animated text elements, such as a pulsing effect on the name, drawing attention to key information.
